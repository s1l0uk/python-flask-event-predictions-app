                    brings us another occasion to pit everyone against each other for
                    the title of the ultimate football clairvoyant!

                    {{ event.name }} Predictions Competition!
                </p>

                <p class="text-margin-top">The game will run two concurrent competitions:</p>

                <h4 class="text-margin-top">The sweepstake competition</h4>
                <p>
                    The basic game that will allocate you a team at random when you sign up!
                    The longer your team stays in the tournament the closer to victory you will
                    be!
                    However, that's not all! There is a good chance that there will be more players
                    in this competition than teams available to allocate... When this happens the
                    teams draw will be reset and a fresh set will start to be allocated, this means
                    you may have to share the glory if you are sharing your team!
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-margin-top">The score prediction competition</h4>
                <p>
                    The second competition is a fun predictions game to help crown the true winner!
